# Background
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_dynamics\
Molecular dynamics are the use of computer simulations to numerically estimate the trajectory of a system. 

# Methodology
Molecular dynamics simulations typically have 5 main steps.

1. Initialization of particle positions and particle velocities.

2. Calculate forces and update positions and velocities according to an integration technique. 

3. Apply boundary conditions and control temperature or pressure if needed.

4. Calculate relevant statistics of the system.

5. Repeat step 2-4 until a fixed number of time steps have elapsed.
